Fireworks Interview Task

Abstract:
Run FireWorks_Demo.exe located in Solution folder (rename "change" extension into "exe").
	- Every click on window "shoots" a single firework.
	- Every firework runs in a thread.
	- Clicking multiple times, fast/slow will give a nice show of fireworks, simultaneously. 

Task:
		
1. Open the starter Fireworks.csproj project. Run!
	- Every click on window draw a point. 
	- Inside the DrawPoint(...) method you can see examples of how to draw a line and a circle.
   
2. Your task is to modify the code and create a nice fireworks show on your own:

	- Please make sure it runs in parallel like the Demo.
	- Fireworks can be all kinds of shapes (rectangle, round etc)
	- Colors are important
	- Well defined interfaces/classes/structures etc.
	- Please organize your code, in organized project files.
	- Please make sure the code is well protected (hint: critical sections are locked properly)
	- Documentation is important!
	- Logging capabilities for debugging is recommended.
	- User friendly...do not hold main thread (no problem with resizing/modifying the window while animation is running)
	- Statistics? (i.e firework counter)
	
 
Good luck
